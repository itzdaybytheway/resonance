  <h3>
    Our Mission
  </h3>
  <p><strong>
   Resonance was created by two high school students, hoping to create a tutoring organization that helps people get better at their instrument. Since then, we have put in hundreds of hours tutoring students and building this organization.  
  </strong>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Our Standards
  </h3>
  
  <p><strong>
    Generally, we tutor beginning students that have just begun their instrument to intermediate students that have played for a few years. We try to remain in the age range from 6 to 14, so we can offer adequate help to the student. Usually, we prefer students that are already enrolled in a school band, but we can take students that are not. Our tutoring curriculum consists of tone production, fundamentals, basic music theory, and much more.
